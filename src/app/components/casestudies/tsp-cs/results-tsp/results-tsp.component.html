<p>This is an optimal tour for the qa194 TSP instance. It has length 9352.</p>
<p>The results of our runs with SciFlow are included in the following table. Although the optimal solution of 9,352 wasn’t reached, we observed a significant convergence with the introduction of the framework’s methodology.</p>
<p>Notice the following; </p>
<ul>
<li>Result A vs. Result B indicates running the algorithm with and without, stops in the control thread. Using steps (pauses) in the control thread has lead to better convergence.</li>
<li>Result B vs. Result C demonstrate the benefit of running several Parsl instances in parallel, leading to a better quality solution. </li>
<li>The number of Parsl instances, the number of PSO particles and the number of steps in the control thread are positively correlated with the quality of the solution. </li>
</ul>

<p>The results obtained provide us with a strong indication that the SciFlow framework can be applied easily and successfully, in enhancing the TSP-PSO algorithm. Further, this case study also demonstrate the ability to apply the SciFlow framework, to loop-like behaviour, which is nor possible in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based solutions.</p>
