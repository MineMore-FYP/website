<p>Evaluating the SciFlow framework was performed under the following criteria; </p>
<ul>
<li>Running SciFlow on three different Parsl configurations
  <ul>
    <li>Threads on a local machine</li>
    <li>Utilizing cores of a local machine</li>
    <li>On a cluster</li>
  </ul>

</li>
<li>Removing the Golang control thread from the framework, while leaving Parsl. The individual python modules were called from a shell script. With Parsl left, we evaluated again with the same three configurations mentioned above. </li>
<li>Removing implicit parallelism (Parsl) from the framework and running the Go control thread.</li>
<li>Removing both Parsl and Go. The individual modules were run using a shell script. </li>
</ul>

<p>We ran the above scenarios on a cluster consisting of 4 machines; three machines with 4GB RAM and one machine with 12GB RAM. The dataset used, consists of three months of GDELT data. </p>
<p>The results are as follows; </p>
