<h3>Generate multiple instances</h3>

<p>With SciFlow you can spawn many instances of the same module in parallel, with very little trouble!  A simple ‘for’ loop enables Parsl to generate and execute multiple instances. </p>

<p>This feature comes in handy for dynamic decision making. Let us consider the following example;</p>

<p>Assume that you would like to perform Hyper-Parameter Optimization (parameter tuning) on the K-Means algorithm. SciFlow would generate several instances of the K-Means algorithm, each with a different number of clusters.</p>

<p>Based on the accuracy levels of the resulting instances, SciFlow could make a decision at run-time (dynamically), about the most appropriate set of parameters. The path would be directed along this path thereafter.   </p>

<p>Attaining this with SciFlow is easy! Just follow the below steps. </p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a ‘@python_app’ annotated python function. </li>
<li>Within the same module call the function in a for loop and in the below format.</li>
</ol>

<div id="codeSnippet">
<pre>
  <code>
results = []
for i in numberOfClusters:
    app_future = kmeans(i)
    results.append(app_future)

# wait for all apps to complete
return_array = [r.result() for r in results]
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Begin by defining a results array.</li>
<li>Within a for loop, call the K-Means function to an app_future.</li>
<li>At the end of the for loop, wait for all iterations to return with r.result(). </li>
</ul>
</div>
