<h3>Channel Coordination</h3>
<p>SciFlow uses channels to facilitate communication between modules. With channel coordination SciFlowâ€™s control thread would detect completion of events, providing an event-driven nature to the workflow. When one end of the channel receives a string, this signals the completion of a module, leading to the invocation of the next module. The string received, is now sent to the next step.  </p>
<p>The general code structure for channel coordination is explained in Step 04 : Writing your control thread.</p>
<p>Special workflow structures exist to assist you in building a variety of workflow structures.</p>

<b>Forks</b>
<p>The same module needs to be directed to two different modules. These could belong to the same workflow branch or different branches.</p>

<p>Write the control logic in the same way above. Make sure to number the in/out channels properly to get the workflow you intended!  </p>

<b>Intersections</b>
<p>A module would require the input of two separate modules. These too could belong to the same workflow branch or different branches.</p>

<p>Define a separate function for message passing in integrate situation as below and call this function within the control thread.</p>
