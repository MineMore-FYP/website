<p>The SciFlow framework could be used for a wide range of scientific workflow applications. </p>

<p>Below we highlight some case studies utilizing SciFlow;<p>

<h3>A Dynamic Data Analytics workflow</h3>

<p>Data Analytics consists of applying a sequence of steps in order to extract knowledge. This fits well with the workflow model weâ€™re trying to enhance with SciFlow. Our project seeks to apply the SciFlow framework, in a Data Analytics context, in order to predict social unrest using the <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/">GDELT</a> (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) dataset. Additional data is captured from the <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) dataset.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we construct the below data analytics workflow, which include the following features;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple workflow components</li>
  <li>Interacting workflow modules</li>
  <li>Reusable and parallelizable modules</li>
  <li>Complex workflow constructs, such as intersections and forks</li>
  <li>Dynamic decision making</li>
</ul>
