<p>The SciFlow framework could be used for a wide range of scientific workflow applications. </p>

<p>Below we highlight some case studies utilizing SciFlow;<p>

<h3>A Dynamic Data Analytics workflow</h3>

<p>Data Analytics consists of applying a sequence of steps in order to extract knowledge. This fits well with the workflow model weâ€™re trying to enhance with SciFlow. Our project seeks to apply the SciFlow framework, in a Data Analytics context, in order to predict social unrest using the <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/">GDELT</a> (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) dataset. Additional data is captured from the <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/">ACLED</a> (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project) dataset.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we construct the below data analytics workflow, which include the following features;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple workflow components</li>
  <li>Interacting workflow modules</li>
  <li>Reusable and parallelizable modules</li>
  <li>Complex workflow constructs, such as intersections and forks</li>
  <li>Dynamic decision making</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Particle Swarm Optimization solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem</h3>

<p>The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem, where the task is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once, when a list of cities and their pairwise distances are given.  </p>

<img class="media-object" src="../../../assets/png/tsp/1_3Ct_bqpIsDVnMEJh6R29Hw.png" width="600">

<p>We apply a Particle Swarm Optimization based algorithm to the TSP. </p>
<p>With SciFlow, the control thread can make decisions on the path to re-direct. By allowing the control thread to communicate the gbest parameter values, we have succeeded in attaining better convergence with the global minima.   </p>
<p>Parsl would initialize a set of PSO instances with the same parameter set (number of iterations, number of particles, alpha and beta). The control thread would capture the gbest values from these instances, and would generate a new set of Parsl-PSO instances, with this value as beginning gbest. This process is depicted in the below image and would provide better direction and faster convergence to the algorithm.  </p>

<p>The control thread coordination multiple steps of the algorithm, function as a workflow. Dynamicity is brought in by the control thread selecting the gbest and initializing instances accordingly. </p>
<p>The results obtained provide us with a strong indication that the SciFlow framework can be applied easily and successfully, in enhancing the TSP-PSO algorithm. </p>
