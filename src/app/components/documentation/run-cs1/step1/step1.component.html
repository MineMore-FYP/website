  <h3>Step 01 : Constructing your modules</h3>

<p>Individual workflow modules go inside the “workflow” folder of the SciFlow framework. You can break the workflow into several components as you wish. Do so by adding a subfolder within the workflow folder.</p>

<p>Our workflow consists of three workflow components;</p>

<ul>
  <li>WFComponent1, which includes student greeting module.</li>
  <li>WFComponent2, which includes all calculation modules.</li>
  <li>WFComponent3, for conveying to the student whether he had an amazing or terrible semester, in comparison to his peers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within these workflow components, python modules need to be written, for the required functionalities. Such modules are reusable, and therefore, can be repurposed for any workflow you write hereafter. Accordingly, our workflow comprises of the following python modules.</p>

<p>Make sure that your modules print a string at the very end! This is sent through a channel and is important to detect completion of the module.</p>

<div id="codeSnippet">
<pre><code>print("Module Completed : Calculate Class Average")</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In future, when you intend to construct a different workflow, write your modules here. You can even re-use the modules we have written in our projects at; </p>
