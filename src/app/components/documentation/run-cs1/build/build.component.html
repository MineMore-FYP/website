<h3>Build your own workflow!</h3>

<p>Lets summarize the steps you would have to follow in order to construct a workflow using SciFlow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Constructing your modules</b>
    <br>
    <p>Formulate the workflow you would like to construct.</p>
    <p>Navigate to the ‘workflow’ folder.</p>
    <p>Create subfolders within the ‘workflow’ folder for each workflow component. Name these folders as appropriate. </p>
    <p>Write the workflow modules within these subfolders, as python functions.</p>
    <p>Make sure that there is a print statement at the end of each module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Identify Parallelizable functions</b>
    <br>
    <p>Identify functions that could be performed in parallel.</p>
    <p>Annotate such functions with the <b>@python_app</b> decorator.</p>
    <p>Call the function using a ‘for’ loop, in order to execute parallely. The for loop is to be written within the python module in subject. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Giving your inputs</b>
    <br>
    <p>Write the user inputs necessary for running the python modules in the ‘workflow/userScript.py’ file. </p>
    <p>Assigning numbers to workflow modules. Make sure to include the assigned number with a single hash (#) and the calling module path with double hash marks (##). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Writing your control thread</b>
    <br>
    <p>Think back to the workflow you formulated in step 01. Let’s construct the control thread in accordance with that workflow!</p>
    <p>Within the main function of the ‘controlThread.go’ file, call the workflow modules using the numbers assigned in userScript.py. Write the control thread code in the following format.</p>
    <pre><code>
    outChannelModule&lt;n&gt; := make(chan string, 1)
    go pythonCall("workflow/"+commandsArray[&lt;i&gt;], outChannelModule&lt;n&gt;, "1")
    go messagePassing(outChannelModule&lt;n-1&gt;, outChannelModule&lt;n&gt;)
    fmt.Println(&lt;- outChannelModule&lt;n&gt;)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Apply additional workflow construct where necessary, by following the instructions given in <a href="https://sciflow-fyp.github.io/Documentation/special-workflow-constructs">Special Workflow Constructs</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Dynamic decision making</b>
    <br>
    <p>Write the decision making function as a golang function, in the controlThread.go file. </p>
    <p>Within the main function in controlThread.go file, direct channels to the appropriate module with an ‘if’ condition. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Configuring Parsl </b>
    <br>
    <p>Load the pre-written configurations in the <b>workflow/parslConfig.py</b> file.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Following these steps you can build any type of scientific workflow in future!</p>
