<h4><b>Introduction to your first SciFlow Workflow</b></h4>

<p>Let us explore the possibilities provided by SciFlow with a simple example.</p>

<p>Mrs. Branson, Central High School’s Mathematics teacher wants to create a portal where her students could inquire whether they performed well during a semester or not. Student performance is calculated based on 10 different assignments given throughout the semester and marks are given out of 50 for each.</p>

<p>Mrs. Branson has the following data with her;</p>
Student Name.
Eg : “John”
List of student’s marks for the 10 assignments, out of 50.
 Eg : [23,45,26,47,28,38,46,43,32,44]
The total assignment marks for the rest of the students, out of 1000.
Eg : [927,734,358,212,938,603,912,592,657,556,740,625,495,864,346,623,824,543,951,591,833,340,690,544,797,818,847,791,727,652,856,651,686,964,765,732,662,674,714]
The SciFlow framework could be easily used to construct a workflow in order to achieve Mrs. Branson’s vision.
