<h3>What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A Workflow is the definition, execution and automation of a process where tasks, information or documents
are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules.</p>

<p>A workflow could be viewed as a graph. However, unlike a Directed Acyclic Graph, workflows permit applications
  to be defined as loops. </p>

<p>Contemporary scientific applications often require large-scale, multiple-simulation,
  complex pipelines in order to facilitate new knowledge discovery. Therefore, workflows have emerged
  as a paradigm providing much needed simplicity in defining complex distributed scientific applications.
  Such scientific workflows enable scientists to plug-in any scientific data source or module, inspect and
  visualize knowledge.</p>
<p>The workflow approach for scientific problem solving provides the following benefits; </p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a declarative way for specifying the high-level logic of an application, hiding the low- level details (<b>abstraction</b>)</li>
  <li><b>Integrate</b> existing software modules, datasets, and services in complex compositions</li>
  <li>Ability to store and retrieve workflow components for modifications or re-execution (<b>reusability</b>)</li>
</ul>

<p>SciFlow provides such workflows, allowing you to express complex scientific processes in reusable modules
  and construct a workflow based on a defined set of rules. SciFlow’s workflows could be broken down into
  several components, in order to provide for the user’s natural way of thinking. These workflow components
  would group together several similar modules.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the below example image of the static workflow, we can observe that;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Task 01 belongs to Workflow Component 01</li>
  <li>Task 02 and 03 belong to Workflow Component 02</li>
  <li>Task 04 belongs to Workflow Component 03</li>
</ul>

<p>In a real-world context, let us consider a Data Analytics workflow. Cleaning modules such as, column
  selection and replacing missing values could be packaged under the “Cleaning” workflow component, while mining
  modules such as, linear regression, neural networks etc could be packaged under the “Mining”
   workflow component.</p>
