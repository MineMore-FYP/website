<h3>Dynamic Workflows</h3>

<p>A workflow can be either static or dynamic. <b>Static</b> workflows require the flow of the entire workflow to
  be defined well in advance.</p>

<p>Dynamic workflows are considered in cases where the workflow structure cannot be determined ahead of time, requiring a part of the workflow to be generated automatically. </p>
<p>Dynamic workflows could be further divided based on the flow of information between the analysis activities in the workflow. A workflow could display dynamicity in two forms;</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Data flow dependencies :</b> In such instances, the next step of the workflow is determined by the data produced in earlier steps.</li>
  <li><b>Control flow dependencies :</b> The structure of the Big Data analysis solution is determined by the domain expert that orchestrates the data analysis activities in the workflow.</li>
</ul>

<p>SciFlow considers cases of Control Flow Dependent Dynamic workflows. The control thread would make a decision, based on a function written by you, and change the workflowâ€™s path during run-time.</p>
